# Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns, independence from frameworks, and testability. This architectural approach, popularized by Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob"), helps create systems that are:

- **Maintainable**: Easy to change and update
- **Testable**: Simple to write automated tests for
- **Independent**: Not tightly coupled to external frameworks or tools

## Key Principles

Clean Architecture is built on several fundamental principles:

### 1. Dependency Rule

Dependencies always point inward. Inner layers know nothing about outer layers.

### 2. Separation of Concerns

The architecture is divided into concentric layers, each with its own responsibility:

- **Domain/Entities Layer**: Contains enterprise-wide business rules and entities
- **Use Cases/Application Layer**: Contains application-specific business rules
- **Interface Adapters Layer**: Converts data between use cases and external formats
- **Frameworks & Drivers Layer**: Contains frameworks, tools, and delivery mechanisms

### 3. Dependency Inversion

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Why Use Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture offers several advantages for C# applications:

- **Framework Independence**: Your business logic remains separate from UI, database, or any external framework
- **Testability**: Core business logic can be tested without external dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Changes to external elements (UI, database) don't affect business rules
- **Flexibility**: You can swap out components (database, UI framework) with minimal impact
