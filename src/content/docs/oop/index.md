# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and code. C# is a primarily object-oriented language that fully embraces OOP concepts.

## Core OOP Principles

In this section, you'll learn about the four fundamental principles of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.

2. **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit characteristics from another class, enabling code reuse and establishing a relationship between classes.

3. **Polymorphism**: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms or data types, allowing methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon.

4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

## Why OOP Matters

Understanding OOP principles is crucial for C# developers because:

- **Organization**: OOP helps organize code into reusable and modular components
- **Maintenance**: Well-designed object-oriented code is easier to maintain and extend
- **Collaboration**: OOP facilitates team collaboration by creating clear boundaries between components
- **Problem Solving**: OOP encourages thinking about problems in terms of real-world objects and their interactions

## Topics Covered

In this section, you'll learn about:

- [Classes and Objects](/oop/classes-objects): The fundamental building blocks of OOP
- [Inheritance](/oop/inheritance): Creating class hierarchies and code reuse
- [Polymorphism](/oop/polymorphism): Writing flexible and extensible code
- [Encapsulation](/oop/encapsulation): Protecting data and implementing information hiding
- [Abstraction](/oop/abstraction): Simplifying complex systems by focusing on what matters
- [Interfaces](/oop/interfaces): Creating contracts for classes to implement

Each article includes practical examples to help you understand how these concepts are applied in real C# code.
